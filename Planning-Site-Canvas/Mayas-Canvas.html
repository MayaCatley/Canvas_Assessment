<p>I recognised that my canvas' boundaries didn't allow the user to touch the drawing guide with the canvas boarder, and that the user
wasn't able to continue drawing the shape if the boarder has already been touched. Preferably I would like the shape to cut off when
touching the boarder of the canvas, or allow the user to continue drawing a shape elsewhere in one movement. I will fix this in a
future Sprint, as currently I would like to get more shape and colour options before fixing the smaller details.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>This Sprint works well and achieves what I was after. It works very simply by only allowing the user to draw a guide and rectangles.</p>
<p>However this allows me to improve my program in future sprints, and has given me a variety of options for where I can improve
my program. Through my testing I was able to recognise that there were lots of errors with my program as I mentioned above, such as
the boarder of my canvas which will have to be fixed in a later sprint.</p>
<p>I would like to work on adding buttons and another shape in Sprint 2, as that will make my program more like a drawing program,
by giving the user more options and more artistic freedom.</p>
<hr>

<h1 id="Sprint2">Sprint Two</h1>
<p>The aim of Sprint Two is to allow the user to select either the ellipse or rectangle button, and then draw the shape accordingly.</p>

<p>I struggled with the buttons creating different shapes, I realised this is because I was calling the shapes with capital letters,
when I initially had them defined with lower case letters. This was a hard to find error, but super simple when I recognised what
the problem was. I also had a few unnecessary lines of code that I was able to remove, this allowed me to find the error more
efficiently.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Sprint 2 was a big success, and I was able to get the basis for a good drawing program. Now the user is given choices and options,
allowing for more creativity and freedom. This is crucial for a drawing program, so I prioritised including this feature over
my other ideas on my kanban. I came across a few problems, however, the main one was actually getting the functionality to work,
I had no trouble with the drawing guides, however it was difficult to have a button create a different shape. This was a simple fix,
and showed me the importance of making sure I was properly calling parts of my code.</p>
<p>In my next sprint I really want to establish a way for the user to change the colour of shapes, to do this I was to have a swatch
of variety of colours for the user to select, however, to simplify this, I may initially make only a few colour options.</p>
<hr>
<hr>

<h1 id="Sprint3">Sprint Three</h1>
<p>The aim of Sprint Three is to have a colour palate that the user can use to change the colour of the shapes.</p>

<p>I came across an error where the left side of my canvas had working boundaries, however, the right side did not. I realised this was
because I had the program checking for the mouse in the wrong boundaries.</p>
<code class=""javascript+> if(xMouse > x && yMouse < x+w && yMouse > y && yMouse < y+h)</code>
<br>
<p>I realised that I needed to change it to</p>
<code class=""javascript+> if(xMouse > x && xMouse < x+w && yMouse > y && yMouse < y+h)</code>
<br>
<p>Now the code works and so do the boundaries.</p>

<h4>Sprint Four Testing</h4>
<br>
<p>I decided to create a separate testing folder for adding the drawing area, as I wanted to test the functionality without all of my additional
buttons and shapes. This was beneficial as I had a much simpler code to use as a base, and allowed me to find and fix errors more efficiently.
To do this I copied the code from my first sprint and added the drawing area code onto it, once it worked, I then added the new code onto
my actual sprint.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>While my initial plan for this sprint was to create an undo and redo button, I decided to change my plan and make a clear button
instead of a redo button. I am hoping to try and create a redo button in thr future, however, I realised this was too ambitious
for sprint 5. A redo button would mean duplicating my shape list, so I would have to be able to go through the history on one list and have the
other list actually representing what is on the canvas. I decided instead to make a clear button as the code was not too different to
the undo button and because a clear option would be more helpful for users.</p>
<p>This was another decision in which I had to decide between two options to determine what would work best for my program. Where inevitably I
had to consider practicality from not only the users perspective but also what I could manage in Sprint 5.</p>
<p>Sprint 5 went pretty smoothly, and I didn't face many problems. In my next sprint I am looking to add more shapes and colours to give the
user more creative freedom.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>I made the choice in this sprint to change the way the colours appeared, prior they went transparent when hovered over or selected,
which could give the user the wrong idea of what colour they were picking. This is why I decided to make them not only larger but have the
stroke change instead, so the colour remained the same. This almost meant I could add transparent colours as an option.</p>
<p>Along with changing the appearance of the colours, I also changed the appearance of the program, I made it so the colours are on the far
left side along with the buttons being in a line going downwards. This looks neater and also makes sense logically as we read from the left
to the right.</p>
<p>The picture below shows what my program looks like now vs how it looked prior.</p>

<p>I had to make a decision about how I wanted the slider to appear on the canvas. I wanted this slider to be used for both the pen and

<img class="img-responsive" width="70%" src="assets/img/sliderbaroptions.png" alt="">
<p>I decided to choose the option on the right as it felt less cramped and made sense aesthetically. It did however mean that the buttons
would be smaller than the others, although I ended up preferring them this way as it showed the different between the MouseDown shapes and
then MouseUp drawing options.</p>
